# Accident-Detection-and-prevention
The idea behind Road Accident Safety System is to automatically detect an accident and alert the nearest hospitals and police stations about it. This system can also locate the place of the accident so that the medical services can be directed immediately towards it. Accident Detection and Messaging System execution is simple as the system makes use of GSM and GPS technologies. GPS is used for taking the coordinates of the site of the accident while GSM is used for sending the message. The system also includes Driver Drowsiness and Distraction Detection mechanism. It is very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy. The system uses a small camera that points directly towards the driver’s face and monitors the driver’s eyes in order to detect fatigue and when it is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver. Along with this, the driver will also get an alert to monitor the speed of vehicle when he is driving in accident prone and heavily crowded areas.
